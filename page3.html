<h2> <b>Gemma's Reflection <b></h2>
<p> <ul> 
	<li> <I>knowledge gained </I></li>
		<p>Working on designing a website is pretty challenging, however, 
			I like the fact that I gained 
			so much technical vocabulary and able to understand their meaning,
			that's pretty awesome I reckon. I really like the task because it 
			made be the center of the learning process, where, I experience everything from frustration
			to relieved and proud. 
			I really value the idea of understanding the foundamentals of digital design and design process 
			because I makes me appreciate and expercience the visual effect of every characters,
			tags and details that
			I encode. It comples me think that every brush stroke in fine arts and
			every single character input in modern 
			web design, especially the styling script for the aesthetic 
			value of the website that I am working on.</p>
	<br>
		<p> I have to admit that, at first, my goal of doing the project 
			is just for the subject, I am glad that just as I
			start reading about the task of creating a website, the
			interest creeps in and it's been an awesome learning journey 
			so far. From the experience of working on the task, provided me 
			to be creative, critical and investigative in the project that we are doing.
			I would say, this made up my learning framework combining the knowledge,
			understanding and abstraction of the design theory or design cicle by Mickel Hjorts.
			In- school-practice and peer-to-peer learning, have been beneficial to
			my learning acquisition. This enabled be to go through the six
			important design processes: <i> Design Brief, Field study, 
			Ideation, Fabrication,Argumentation and Reflection. </i>		
	</p>
	
	<li> <I>skills gained </I> </li>
		<p> The subtle acquisition of using the tags, understanding the elements, the variables and many more details of the scripting language is such a 
			fantastic addition to my skills. Maybe I could be a front-end developer if I am not teaching. </p>
	
</ul> </p>
